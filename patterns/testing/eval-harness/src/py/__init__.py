Eval Harness

Import from the individual modules directly:
    from eval_harness import EvalHarness, ExactMatchScorer, ...
    from eval_types import EvalCase, ScorerResult, ...
    from mock_provider import MockProvider, MockProviderConfig

This __init__.py is intentionally kept empty of imports to avoid
shadowing pytest's 'py' package during test collection.
