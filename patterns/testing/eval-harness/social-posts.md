GPT-4's code generation accuracy dropped from 52% to 10% across a single model update. Same inputs. Same prompts. No notification.

Without systematic evaluation, prompt changes ship on vibes. A developer tweaks summarization, tests three examples, ships it. Meanwhile, entity extraction broke and hallucination rates jumped from 3% to 18%. Nobody noticed for two weeks.

The fix isn't assertion tests — checking output contains a keyword or meets a length. Those catch structure, not semantics. What I'd want: continuous scorers with baseline comparison, sliced by category. That way "improved overall but degraded on entity extraction" gets caught before deploy.

The harness adds ~0.04ms/case overhead. Code-only scoring costs $0.88/day for a 50-case suite. One caught regression pays for months of that.

1/ GPT-4's code gen accuracy dropped from 52% to 10% in a single model update. Same inputs, same prompts.

Without an eval harness, there's no way to know this happened until users complain. 🧵

2/ The naive approach: eyeball 5 examples, maybe write keyword assertions. This catches structure but not semantics — a response can pass every assertion and still be wrong.

Tag-based sliced scoring catches what flat assertions miss.

3/ Numbers from benchmarking:
- ~0.04ms/case harness overhead
- 100% concurrency efficiency
- Code-only scoring: $0.88/day for 50 cases
- GPT-4o-mini judges cost 17x less than GPT-4o

One caught regression pays for months of eval infra.

4/ Full eval harness pattern — dataset + scorers + comparison pipeline. TypeScript and Python, 6 benchmark scenarios, cost analysis, and ops runbook.
